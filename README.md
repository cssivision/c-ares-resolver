# c-ares-resolver #

A more convenient API around [`c-ares`](https://github.com/dimbleby/rust-c-ares/), for asynchronous DNS requests.

The `c-ares` crate provides a safe wrapper around the underlying C library, but it's relatively hard work to use: the user needs to drive the polling of file descriptors according to `c-ares` demands, which likely involves writing something close to a full-blown event loop.

This crate does that hard work for you so that the presented API is much more straightforward.
